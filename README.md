## Introduction to Map Reduce Algorithm

## My To-DO List for this Assignment

- Make a function to download all data files. Follow same convention on assignmnent2.
- Download the data, using threading.
- Make a function to read all downloaded files.
- Make a function to count the number of airlines.

## Introductory Knowledge on Concepts

TBD

## Tasks

The goal for this assignment is to implement the MapReduce algorithm instructions to a dataset and take advantage of this algorithm. The problem we are trying to solve is very simple, however, with an iterative approach, it may be hard to find the solution because of that size of the dataset.

Your task is to use MapReduce and find the # of flights each airline made so far, for the period of 1989 to 2009.

As always, I made the hardest part, used the iterative approach to find the solution. And as you will see in the notebook, it takes quite a lot of time.

Following is the list of your, tasks.

### Setup

- [ ] Load the entire dataset into a DataFrame.

### EDA

- More to come!

### MapReduce

- [ ] Find the counts of all airlines using MapReduce algorithm.

## What are All These Files?

Following table is will give it a meaning for each file.

File                | Description 
-------             | ----------- 
README.md           | A descriptive file to give an introduction of current project/ assignment. Includes a todo list that **you have to edit**.
LICENCE             | The licence of the file that every project should have.
.gitignore          | The file to control which files should be ignored by Git.
.gitkeep            | An empty file to keep folders under git.
requirements.txt    | A list of python packages you may need for the assignment.
Assignment3.ipynb   | Sample notebook as a reference for how your notebooks should be organized.
data_handler.py     | Helper functions to do HW related tasks, all serial way.
